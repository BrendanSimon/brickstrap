# Prefer packages from ev3dev over other origins. This way if Debian releases
# a newer version of a package that we have modified, the new Debian version
# will not be installed (because it will probably break something).
#
# NOTE: This pinning only takes effect AFTER a package has been installed. In
# other words, this only affects upgrades. This means that ev3dev package
# versions will NOT be preferred when installing them initially unless the
# package itself is pinned with a lower priority

Package: *
Pin: release o=ev3dev

# These are the packages in the ev3dev repository that have the same name as
# official debian packages. These rules in conjunction with the rule above
# cause the ev3dev version of the package to be preferred when installing.
