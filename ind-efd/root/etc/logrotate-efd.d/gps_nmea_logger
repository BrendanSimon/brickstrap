#! limit size to 100MB, 7 rotations.
#!
#! copytruncate is required as the script does not have hooks to close
#! the file and reopen a new logfile.
#!
#! there is a small time slice between copying and truncating, which means
#! there is potential for a small loss of data during that period.
#!
#! takes about 10 seconds to copy a 100MB file.
#! takes about 64 seconds to compress a 100MB file (random binary data).
#! compression ratio is approximately 20:1 for text data.
