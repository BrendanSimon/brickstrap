#!
#! NOTE !!!
#!
#! `gpsd-clients` adds an extra 110MB to the rootfs !!
#! as it pulls in a lot of other dependencies (python3, gtk, etc).
#!
#! Unfortunately, `gpscat` has moved to `gpsd-clients` in `experimental` repo
#! (for all architectures - except IA64 for some reason)
#!
#! We might just have to wear that for now, unless the maintainer can
#! optimise the dependencies or move gpscat back into `python-gps`
#!
