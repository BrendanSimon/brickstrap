# Prefer packages from ev3dev over other origins. This way if Debian releases
# a newer version of a package that we have modifed, the new Debian version
# will not be installed (because it will probably break something).
Package: *
Pin: release o=ev3dev
Pin-Priority: 1001

# NOTE: Pinning only takes effect AFTER a package has been installed. In other
# words, this only affect upgrades. This means that ev3dev package versions will
# NOT be preferred when installing them initally. To work around this, you must
# manually specify the package version when installing (e.g. apt-get install
# <package-name>=<version>) or run apt-get upgrade after apt-get install.
